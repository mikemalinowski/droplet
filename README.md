Droplet
=======

**WARNING:** This is a in-progress repository and pretty much everything is subject to change at any time! So its advisable to consider this reference rather than a usable plugin at this stage.

Droplet is a mixture of some pretty old code - spruced and tidied - along with some newer nodes. The idea is to provide a utility plugin for maya which exposes some useful nodes to help minimise graph complexity and simplify the implmeentation of some common rigging paradigms.

As the repository matures and becomes stable I'll update this page to reflect which parts are reliable and not subject to change.

Compiled Plug-ins
=================

All the source is available if you want to compile it. However, until the repository stabilises there will only be Maya 2018 (x64-windows) plugins available.

Contributions
=============
Given that this is a relatively new module it is always appreciated if you can communicate any bugs, issues, ideas or recommendations to mike@twisted.space
